    "2] State and explain the features of MOngoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "answer] MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is document-oriented and is used for high volume data storage. MongoDB makes use \n",
    "       of collections and documents, instead of using tables and rows as in the relational databases. Documents contain \n",
    "       key-value pairs which are considered the basic unit of data in MongoDB.\n",
    "       MongoDB Features;\n",
    "       \n",
    "            Document Model\n",
    "-  MongoDB has been designed with developer productivity and flexibility in  mind. It is a document-oriented \n",
    "database, which means that data is stored as documents, and documents are grouped in collections. The document model is\n",
    "a lot more natural for developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Sharding\n",
    "-  Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or “shards.” \n",
    "When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and better execute what might \n",
    "otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries.\n",
    "           Replication\n",
    "- When your data only resides in a single server, it is exposed to multiple potential points of failure, such as\n",
    "a server crash, service interruptions, or even good old hardware failure. Any of these events would make accessing\n",
    "your data nearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "           Authentication\n",
    "- Authentication is a critical security feature in MongoDB. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access\n",
    "the database. Without authentication, anyone can access your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides a number of authentication mechanisms for users to access the database. The most common is the Salted \n",
    "Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), which is the default. When used, SCRAM requires the user to provide \n",
    "an authentication database, username, and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "          Database Triggers \n",
    " - Database triggers in MongoDB Atlas are a powerful feature that allow you to execute code when certain events occur in\n",
    " your database. For example, you can use triggers to execute a script when a document is inserted, updated, or deleted.\n",
    " Triggers can also be scheduled to execute at specific times.\n",
    " \n",
    "         Time Series Data \n",
    "  -Time series data is most commonly generated by a device, such as a sensor, that records data over time. The data \n",
    "  is stored in a collection of documents, each of which contains a timestamp and a value. MongoDB provides a number \n",
    "  of features to help you manage time series data. \n",
    "  \n",
    "         Ad-Hoc Queries\n",
    " - When designing the schema of a database, it is impossible to know in advance all the queries that will be performed by\n",
    " end users. An ad-hoc query is a short-lived command whose value depends on a variable. Each time an ad-hoc query is executed,\n",
    " the result may be different, depending on the variables in question.\n",
