    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "answer]APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of \n",
    "definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather \n",
    "app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.\n",
    "       API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any\n",
    "       software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications.\n",
    "       This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. Their API documentation\n",
    "       contains information on how developers are to structure those requests and responses.\n",

    "answer]        ADVANTAGES\n",
    "1] Applications: Access to APIs ensures more flexibility in information-transfer processes.\n",
    "2] Reach: APIs let you create layers in apps in order to distribute information to different audiences.\n",
    "3] Customization: Furthermore, it can serve as a solution to create different experiences for users, letting protocols,\n",
    "functions, and commands be adapted according to specific demands.\n",
    "4] Efficiency: When you have content that is automatically published and made available on different channels\n",
    "simultaneously, APIs allow for more efficient data distribution.\n",
    "5] Adaptability: One of the greatest benefits of APIs is the ability it has to adapt to changes through data migration\n",
    "and flexibility of services\n",
    "                  DISADVANTAGES\n",
    "There is a lot of conveniences and advantages to APIs, but business leaders should also be aware of the disadvantages.\n",
    "As a single point of entry, an API is a gateway and can become a hacker's primary target. Once the API is compromised,\n",
    "all other applications and systems become vulnerable.                  "

    "Web API is an API as the name suggests, it can be accessed over the web using the HTTP protocol. It is a framework that\n",
