    "Qualitative data, also known as the categorical data, describes the data that fits into the categories. Qualitative data \n",
    "are not numerical. The categorical information involves categorical variables that describe the features such as a person’s\n",
    "gender, home town etc. Categorical measures are defined in terms of natural language specifications, but not in terms of\n",
    "numbers\n",
    "               Nominal Data\n",
    "Nominal data is one of the types of qualitative information which helps to label the variables without providing the numerical\n",
    "value. Nominal data is also called the nominal scale. It cannot be ordered and measured. But sometimes, the data can be \n",
    "qualitative and quantitative. Examples of nominal data are letters, symbols, words, gender etc\n",
    "\n",
    "                 Ordinal Data\n",
    "Ordinal data/variable is a type of data that follows a natural order. The significant feature of the nominal data is that the\n",

    "\n",
    "             qantitative or Numerical Data\n",
    "Quantitative data is also known as numerical data which represents the numerical value (i.e., how much, how often, how many).\n",
    "Numerical data gives information about the quantities of a specific thing. Some examples of numerical data are height, length,\n",

    "from the research.\n",
    "The levels of measurement help us determine what statistical technique is appropriate to use. For example, if the level of\n",
